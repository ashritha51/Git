next ques : brief about hobbies and abt your self and strengths and weakness and conversation

--> about your self....
Good afternoon, I am Ashritha from Sangareddy. I am currently in my third year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at CVR College of Engineering. I completed my intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya, Vattinagulapalli, and my schooling at Sri Chaitanya, Sangareddy.

My mother is a homemaker, and my father is a private employee. I have an elder sibling. I enjoy listening to music and sleeping, but I dislike crowds, heights, and darkness. My strengths include maintaining a positive outlook in challenging situations, staying silent when angry, and being a good listener. On the other hand, I sometimes experience anxiety, especially when I am the center of attention or in crowded places. However, I am working to overcome these challenges through exercises, meditation, and engaging in conversations with others.

I consider myself an ambivert. My role model is MS Dhoni, as I admire his simplicity, leadership skills, and the way he demonstrates that success can be achieved through simplicity.


--> Strengths and Weakness...

My strengths include maintaining a positive outlook in challenging situations, staying silent when angry, and being a good listener. On the other hand, I sometimes experience anxiety, especially when I am the center of attention or in crowded places. However, I am working to overcome these challenges through exercises, meditation, and engaging in conversations with others.

--> Hobbies...

Certainly! My hobbies include drawing, arts, and crafts. I enjoy drawing because it allows me to improve my focus and attention to detail. Art, in general, helps me explore different perspectives and think outside the box, which has been beneficial in other areas of my life.

Crafting, on the other hand, is something I find both relaxing and rewarding. It often involves problem-solving and working with my hands, which enhances my patience and ability to think practically. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also nurture skills like creativity, discipline, and attention to detail, which I believe can be valuable in a professional setting.
